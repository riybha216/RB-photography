# RB Photography

RB Photography was built because I wanted to share my love for capturing the smallest moments with the world. Instead of posting pictures on personal accounts, I wanted to create a portfolio website where I could highlight my best work, allow users to request shoots from me, and contact me to cite my work in a professional manner.

I've iterated over this site multiple times. Initially, I created this website using a template; but, I wanted to display my creativity on my portfolio, which meant being able to customize it. Then, I created version1 one year ago, which depicted a bare outline of the current website. This is my second iteration of designing the portfolio from scratch.

All photographs included are my own work, including the background and profile images. 

# What I Learned:
*  Customizing a user interface requires thought. Using obnoxious, bright colors can stray users away from the main point of the website. Using a balance of stand-out colors on more bland backgrounds can help content pop.
* JavaScript can add interactive elements to websites, especially in those that display information or where space may be limited to add more engaging features. In this specific project, I struggled to find a way for the pictures to be enlarged, especially with the lack of space and the large amount of pictures that had to be displayed. However, using JavaScript, specifically jQuery, to allow the pictures to pop solved this issue in an efficient manner.

# To-dos:
* Create a "contact me" form on the website itself, instead of linking my personal email.
* Host the site using a custom domain, instead of on github pages to gain more traction.
